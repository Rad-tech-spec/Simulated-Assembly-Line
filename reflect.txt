	In general, this project was covering almost everything that we have 
learned through the semester there were some concepts that I have chosen not 
to use such as algorithm because of code performance and efficiency of the 
code and for debugging purposes. Iterators were mainly used in the last 
milestone such as <deque> for back and front access and <vectors> only for 
front access. 

	Combining and accessing other modules was the main idea to choose 
the right member function to use throughout the code to avoid duplication 
of the code. 

	I have had some issues through my coding but with help of the debugging 
tools that VS provides, I was able to track and review each step more focused 
and more sure to fix my issues. To improve this project I would put all the 
modules into a unique namespace so that when looking at modules it is easier 
to read and connect between them. Maybe I would use more lambda expressions 
for syntax and iterator handling. This was a very good practice and was very 
help full to clear some of the concepts that was unclear throughout the semester 
for me.
